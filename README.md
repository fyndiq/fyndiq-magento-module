# fyndiq-magento-module
Fyndiq's official Magento module



### INSTALL
You can just drag the app directory to your magento directory to make the files get added to right place.

We recommend modgit or magento composer installer though, which make it easy with just one command to install the module.

### Good to know
If you have problem after installing the module, like SQL or other problems. Test to clear cache first in admin. Install might not start because of cache and this can cause problems.
